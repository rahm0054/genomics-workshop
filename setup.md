## Required additional software

This lesson requires the following programs:
* A spreadsheet program such as Excel.
* For Windows, you will also need to install: PuTTY and WinSCP 

> ## Windows

> - Installing PuTTY by going to the [the installation page](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). For most newer computers, click on putty-64bit-X.XX-installer.msi to download the 64-bit version. If you have an older laptop, you may need to get the 32-bit version putty-X.XX-installer.msi. If you aren't sure whether you need the 64 or 32 bit version, you can check your laptop version by following [the instructions here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15056/windows-32-64-bit-faq). Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it, and PuTTY should install.
